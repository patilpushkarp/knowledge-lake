    "Consumer packaged goods (CPGs) are everyday items that consumers purchase frequently for personal or household use. These products are typically characterized by their short shelf life, low cost, and high turnover rate, meaning they are bought and consumed quickly. CPGs encompass a wide range of categories, including food, beverages, personal care products, and household cleaning supplies.\n",
    "Key Characteristics of Consumer Packaged Goods\n",
    "1. *Frequent Purchase*: CPGs are items that consumers buy regularly, often as part of their routine shopping trips. Common examples include snacks, beverages, toiletries, and cleaning products.\n",
    "2. *Short Shelf Life*: Many CPGs have a limited lifespan, necessitating regular replenishment. For instance, dairy products and fresh produce need to be restocked frequently due to their perishability.\n",
    "3. *Affordability*: These goods are generally low-cost, making them accessible to a broad range of consumers. This affordability encourages frequent purchases without significant financial burden.\n",
    "4. *High Turnover Rate*: CPGs typically sell in large volumes and move quickly off store shelves, which is why retailers prioritize these products in their inventory.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The consumer packaged goods sector is highly competitive due to the saturation of brands in the market. Companies invest heavily in marketing strategies to differentiate their products from competitors and build brand loyalty among consumers. This includes attractive packaging designs that stand out on store shelves and promotional offers that encourage repeat purchases.  \n",
    "Moreover, the rise of e-commerce has transformed how consumers access CPGs. Many brands now offer online shopping options, which can enhance convenience for consumers looking to replenish their supplies without visiting physical stores."
